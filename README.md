# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

Hi there!  
This is my **first data analysis project**, and I'm excited to share what I’ve learned while working with a **synthetic COVID-19 dataset**. As someone who’s still learning, this project was a great way to explore real-world data (in a simulated form) and practice essential analysis skills — from cleaning data to building a dashboard.

## Project Objectives
- Understand global trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations  
- Identify countries most affected by the pandemic  
- Explore correlations between:
  - GDP per capita & vaccination rate  
  - Stringency index & reproduction rate  
- Visualize data to communicate insights clearly and effectively

## What I Did (Process Overview)
As a beginner, I focused on mastering the fundamentals:
1. **Data Cleaning & Validation** – Removed blanks, duplicates, and obvious errors  
2. **Data Processing** – Structured the dataset using Excel tools (filters, sorting, formatting)  
3. **Exploratory Analysis** – Built PivotTables to answer key questions  
4. **Visualization** – Transformed data into easy-to-read charts  
5. **Dashboard Creation** – Combined everything into an interactive Excel dashboard

## Key Findings
- COVID-19 cases and deaths **decreased** from 2020 to 2022  
- **USA, India, and the UK** had the highest number of reported cases  
- There is **no strong linear correlation** between GDP per capita and vaccination rate  
- Strict government policies **don’t always** result in lower virus reproduction rates

## Dataset
This dataset is **synthetic** and sourced from **Kaggle**. It was a great resource for learning in a safe and beginner-friendly environment.

## A Note from Me
As this is my **first step into data analytics**, I’d love to hear your feedback!  
Feel free to share suggestions or connect — I’m always eager to learn and grow.
