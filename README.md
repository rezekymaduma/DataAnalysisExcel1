# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

Welcome! 
This project explores a **synthetic COVID-19 dataset** to uncover global insights about the pandemic’s **spread, impact, and response** across different countries and continents. It emphasizes key metrics like total cases, deaths, testing, vaccinations, and policy measures.

---

## Project Goals
- Analyze global trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations  
- Identify countries with the highest number of cases and deaths  
- Explore correlations between:
  - GDP per capita & vaccination rate  
  - Stringency index & reproduction rate  
- Present insights through interactive dashboards and visualizations  

---

## Process Overview
1. **Data Cleaning & Validation** – Removed duplicates and handled missing values  
2. **Data Structuring** – Organized data using filters, formatting, and categorization  
3. **Pivot-Based Analysis** – Used Excel PivotTables to answer key questions  
4. **Visualization** – Created clear and informative charts to reveal trends  
5. **Dashboard Creation** – Compiled visual outputs into an interactive dashboard

## Key Insights
- COVID-19 **cases and deaths declined** from 2020 to 2022  
- **USA, India, and the UK** had the highest number of cases  
- **GDP per capita** is not strongly correlated with vaccination rates  
- **Stringency index** does not strongly predict reproduction rates

## Dataset
- The dataset is **synthetic** and sourced from **Kaggle**
